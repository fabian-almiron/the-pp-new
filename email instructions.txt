Ok the setup is complete! 

I've created a readme file in the repo that covers everything including file structure. 
Just start a new project folder on your computer, and follow the directions on the readme file (or feed it to cursor) to get it setup on your machine. 

NOTE: When you push to main it will deploy a build on vercel (hosting) and i've included a live link in the readme file. 

Let me know if you have any questions!

ALSO, follow the directions in the readme (or feed it to cursor) about starting a new branch call it "dev" If we push to main we might have a lot of server (vercel) costs ♥️
