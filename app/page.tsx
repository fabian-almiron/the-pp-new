            <p>I fell in love with buttercream flowers four years ago, inspired by my passion for food. Food is a love language that bonds family, friends and communities-there's a reason everyone gathers in the kitchen! I wanted to find a way to share food's beauty, and buttercream flowers were it!</p>
            <p>Learning to pipe buttercream flowers wasn't easy. First, I had to learn all about piping tips on my own, which felt like learning a whole new language. Then, I spent hours watching unhelpful videos that produced flowers that were flat and unrealistic looking. The hardest part? There was no one to turn to for guidance if I couldn't get a technique. I was all alone on my journey.</p>
            <p>That's why I started the Piped Peony Academy. I wanted to build a path for anyone who had a desire and will to learn the craft. Most importantly, I wanted to price it to be affordable, and I wanted to be there to offer guidance and support.</p>

I am not that much of a cake decorator, as my specialty is custom decorated cookies, but the times I have had to supply a customer cake they have been 'wow'd' with my beautiful flowers.", name: "BARBARA D." },
    { quote: "You will not regret Dara's classes! I've been baking for years, though never had a course in my life about decorating (until Dara's). My piping was all self taught. The amount that I have grown from her course is phenomenal. Her coloring lessons, recipes, and videos are easy to follow & yield the most beautiful results. The community is so helpful for any trouble-shooting too!", name: "DANAE M." },
    { quote: "I've been decorating cakes for 30 years plus! I came across the Piped Peony group and discovered the courses, they are not only very affordable, but give you great details on how to make each flower or mixing colors, or how to make an arrangement.
