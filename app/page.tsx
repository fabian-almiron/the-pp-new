            <p>I fell in love with buttercream flowers four years ago, inspired by my passion for food. Food is a love language that bonds family, friends and communities-there's a reason everyone gathers in the kitchen! I wanted to find a way to share food's beauty, and buttercream flowers were it!</p>
            <p>Learning to pipe buttercream flowers wasn't easy. First, I had to learn all about piping tips on my own, which felt like learning a whole new language. Then, I spent hours watching unhelpful videos that produced flowers that were flat and unrealistic looking. The hardest part? There was no one to turn to for guidance if I couldn't get a technique. I was all alone on my journey.</p>
            <p>That's why I started the Piped Peony Academy. I wanted to build a path for anyone who had a desire and will to learn the craft. Most importantly, I wanted to price it to be affordable, and I wanted to be there to offer guidance and support.</p>
