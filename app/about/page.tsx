                <p>As a mom, wife, foodie, and artist, I turned my passion for flower piping into something more.</p>

                  After watching endless unhelpful YouTube videos, I knew The Piped Peony Academy had the potential to
                  help cottage bakers of all skill levels. I wanted to create a place where bakers could naturally
                  connect with other decorators through our online community to share your creations and learn from
                  others.

                <p>
                  One of my most exciting accomplishments is my signature Blooming Buttercream™, with the texture of
                  Korean buttercream with the flavor of American buttercream. It's perfect for creating every detail.
