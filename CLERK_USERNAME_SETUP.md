# 🔧 Enable Username Login in Clerk

## Problem
You're seeing the error: "Please include an '@' in the email address" when trying to login with a username like "jtest". This is because **username authentication needs to be enabled in your Clerk Dashboard**.

## Solution: Enable Username in Clerk Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Clerk Dashboard
1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Sign in and select your application

### Step 2: Enable Username Authentication
1. In the left sidebar, click **"User & Authentication"**
2. Click on **"Email, Phone, Username"** in the submenu
3. Look for the **"Username"** section
4. Toggle **"Enable username"** to **ON** ✅

You should see options like:
- ✅ Email address
- ✅ Phone number
- ✅ **Username** ← Enable this!

### Step 3: Configure Username Requirements (Optional)
You can also configure:
- **Username requirements**: Minimum length, allowed characters, etc.
- **Username uniqueness**: Whether usernames must be unique

### Step 4: Save and Test
1. Click **"Save"** at the bottom
2. Wait a few seconds for changes to propagate
3. Try logging in with a username again

## What This Does

Once enabled, Clerk will:
- ✅ Accept usernames as valid identifiers for login
- ✅ Allow users to sign up with usernames
- ✅ Removed the "@" validation error for username logins

## Verify It's Working

After enabling username authentication:

1. **Test login with username:**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Enter a username (e.g., "jtest")
   - Enter password
   - Should work without "@" validation error

2. **Test login with email:**
   - Enter an email address
   - Should still work as before

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing the "@" error?
- ✅ Make sure you saved the changes in Clerk Dashboard
- ✅ Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
- ✅ Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- ✅ Clear browser cache

### Username login still not working?
- ✅ Verify the user actually has a username set in Clerk
- ✅ Check Clerk Dashboard → Users → Select user → Verify username is set
- ✅ Make sure usernames are unique (if that's configured)
- ✅ Check browser console for any other errors

## Additional Notes

- **Email will always work** even if username is enabled
- Users can sign in with **either** username **or** email
- The `identifier` field in Clerk accepts both automatically once username is enabled
- Our code already supports this - we just needed Clerk configured correctly!
