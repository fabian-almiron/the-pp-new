## üöÄ How to Use This Right Now

### **Option A: Show the Migration Notice (Recommended)**

The migration notice is **already live** on your login page! It will:
- Appear at the top in a purple gradient banner
- Tell users about the upgrade
- Offer 2 clear options (reset password or use social login)
- Can be dismissed by users

**To test it:**
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. You'll see the elegant cream-colored banner
3. Click "Reset Password" ‚Üí Beautiful modal pops up
4. Enter an email ‚Üí Clerk sends reset email automatically
5. Or click "Use Social Login" ‚Üí Scrolls to OAuth buttons

### **Option B: Hide the Migration Notice**

If you're not ready to show it yet:

```typescript
// In app/login/page.tsx, line 20
const [showMigrationNotice, setShowMigrationNotice] = useState(false); // Change true to false
```

Or control it with an environment variable:

```typescript
// Better approach - use env variable
const [showMigrationNotice, setShowMigrationNotice] = useState(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_MIGRATION_NOTICE === 'true'
);
```

Then in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_MIGRATION_NOTICE=true  # or false to hide
```

## üîê How Password Reset Works

### **Automatic Detection for Migrated Users:**

If a user tries to login with an email that exists in Clerk but has no password set (migrated from WordPress), the system will:

1. **Detect** the missing password automatically
2. **Open** the password reset modal with their email pre-filled
3. **Show** a migration notice: "Welcome to Our Improved Login System"
4. **Guide** them through setting up their password

This provides a seamless experience - users don't need to figure out what went wrong, they're automatically guided to the solution!

### **User Experience (4-Step Process):**

**Step 1: Enter Email**
1. User clicks "Reset Password" in the migration banner OR "Forgot your password?" at the bottom
2. Beautiful modal pops up (matches your site's cream aesthetic)
3. User enters their email address
4. Clicks "Send Code"

**Step 2: Enter 6-Digit Code**
5. **Clerk automatically sends 6-digit code to email**
6. Modal stays open and shows code input field
7. User checks email and enters the 6-digit code
8. Option to resend code if not received
9. Clicks "Verify Code"

**Step 3: Set New Password**
10. Modal shows password entry form
11. User enters new password (with show/hide toggle)
12. User confirms password
13. Clicks "Reset Password"

**Step 4: Success & Auto-Login**
14. Success message appears
15. User is automatically logged in
16. Modal auto-closes after 3 seconds
17. User is redirected to video library

### **Technical Details:**

**Handled by Clerk (Automatic):**
- ‚úÖ Email lookup and validation
- ‚úÖ 6-digit code generation
- ‚úÖ Email delivery (customizable template in Clerk Dashboard)
- ‚úÖ Code expiration (10 minutes default)
- ‚úÖ Code verification and validation
- ‚úÖ Password security requirements (min 8 chars)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- ‚úÖ Secure session creation after reset

**Your Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Beautiful 4-step modal UI (matches your site design)
- ‚úÖ Code input with auto-formatting (numbers only, 6 digits)
- ‚úÖ "Resend code" functionality
- ‚úÖ Password visibility toggles
- ‚úÖ Error handling at each step
- ‚úÖ "Back" buttons to navigate between steps
- ‚úÖ Auto-login after successful reset
- ‚úÖ Smooth animations and transitions

### **Error Messages:**

| Step | User Action | Modal Shows |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Step 1** | Email exists in Clerk | ‚Üí Moves to Step 2 |
| **Step 1** | Email not found | ‚úó "No account found with this email address" |

## üîß Helper Scripts

### **Bulk Password Reset Email (Optional)**

Create `scripts/send-password-resets.js`:

```javascript
import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

const clerk = Clerk({ secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY });

async function sendPasswordResets() {
  // Get all users
  const users = await clerk.users.getUserList();
  
  console.log(`Found ${users.length} users`);
  
  for (const user of users) {
    try {
      // Send password reset email
      await clerk.users.updateUser(user.id, {
        // This triggers Clerk to send reset email
      });
      
      console.log(`‚úÖ Sent reset to: ${user.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress}`);
      
      // Rate limit: wait 100ms between emails
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`‚ùå Failed for: ${user.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress}`, error.message);
    }
  }
  
  console.log('Done!');
}

sendPasswordResets();
```

**Note:** You typically don't need to send reset emails to everyone - just let users reset when they need to login. But this script is here if you want it.

## üÜò Common Questions

### **Q: When should I enable the migration notice?**
A: Enable it 1 week before your actual migration. This gives users time to prepare.

A: Yes! Import a small test group to Clerk first, have them test the flow, then import everyone.

### **Q: What if a user doesn't have email access anymore?**
A: They'll need to create a new account with their current email. You can then manually transfer their purchases/courses in your admin panel.

### **Q: Should I disable old WordPress login immediately?**
A: If possible, keep both active for 1-2 weeks during transition, then fully switch to Clerk.

### **Q: How do I know if the migration is successful?**
A: Check Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Active sessions. You should see increasing activity as users migrate.
