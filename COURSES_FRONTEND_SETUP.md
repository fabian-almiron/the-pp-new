## What's Been Created

The course pages are now fully connected to Strapi and ready to display your imported courses.

### Pages Created

1. **`/app/courses/page.tsx`** - All Courses Listing Page
   - Fetches all courses from Strapi
   - Groups courses by series
   - Beautiful card-based grid layout
   - Shows course images, levels, chapter count
   - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

2. **`/app/courses/[slug]/page.tsx`** - Individual Course Page
   - Fetches single course by slug from Strapi
   - Displays video player with Vimeo integration
   - Shows video chapters with timestamps
   - Lists equipment needed
   - Displays "About" and "What You'll Need" tabs
   - Shows related courses from the same series
   - SEO-optimized metadata

## Features

### All Courses Page (`/courses`)

## Data Conversion

The pages automatically convert Strapi course data to match the existing component structure:

### Video Chapters
- Strapi format: `{ title: "1 Introduction", time: "00.00.01" }`
- Converted to: `{ id: "chapter-0", title: "1 Introduction", videoSrc: "https://player.vimeo.com/video/818412860#t=00.00.01", duration: 0 }`

### Equipment List
- Strapi format: `["powdered sugar", "butter", "mixer"]`
- Converted to: `<ul><li>powdered sugar</li><li>butter</li><li>mixer</li></ul>`

### Related Courses
- Fetches courses from the same series
- Falls back to featured courses if no series match
- Shows thumbnail, title, and link

## URLs

After importing courses and running the frontend:

```
http://localhost:3001/courses
├── american-buttercream
├── vegan-buttercreams
├── anatomy-of-a-buttercream-flower
├── the-rose-bud
├── the-peony-buds

2. **Start Next.js Frontend**:

## Component Structure

```
/courses
  ├── page.tsx (listing page - server component)
  └── [slug]/
      └── page.tsx (detail page - server component)

/components
  ├── course-page-client.tsx (client component for video player)
  ├── video-player.tsx
  ├── chapter-list.tsx
  ├── course-tabs.tsx
  └── content-carousel.tsx

/lib
  └── strapi-api.ts (API functions)
```

## Customization

### Change Course Grid Layout
Edit `/app/courses/page.tsx` line 47:
```tsx
// Current: 3 columns on large screens
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">

// Change to 4 columns:
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
```

### Modify Video Player
The video player uses Vimeo embed URLs. Edit `/app/courses/[slug]/page.tsx` line 18-20 to customize video URLs or add timestamps.

### Add More Related Courses
Change the limit on line 64:
```tsx
.slice(0, 4) // Show 4 related courses
.slice(0, 6) // Show 6 related courses
```

### Style Course Cards
Edit the card styling in `/app/courses/page.tsx` starting at line 48.

## Environment Variables

Make sure you have in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=http://localhost:1337
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
- Check that Strapi is running on port 1337
- Verify `next.config.mjs` has the correct `remotePatterns` for images
- Check that courses have `featuredImage` data in Strapi

### Videos Not Playing
- Verify `videoId` field in Strapi contains valid Vimeo video IDs
- Check Vimeo video privacy settings (must be public or unlisted)
- Check browser console for embed errors

### "Course Not Found" Error
- Verify the slug matches the WordPress slug exactly
- Check that the course is published in Strapi (not draft)
- Verify Public permissions are enabled for Course in Strapi

### Related Courses Not Showing
- Check that courses have a `series` field populated
- Verify there are multiple courses in the same series
- Check that `fetchCoursesBySeries` is working in the API

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Courses are imported to Strapi
2. ✅ Frontend pages are connected to Strapi
3. 🎨 **Customize styling** to match your brand
4. 🔐 **Add authentication** (integrate with existing Clerk setup)
5. 📊 **Add progress tracking** (track which videos users have watched)
6. 🎓 **Add enrollment** (restrict courses by membership level)
7. 🔍 **Add search & filters** (search by title, filter by level/series)

## Success! 🎉

Your courses are now live on the frontend! Users can:
- Browse all 152 courses grouped by series
