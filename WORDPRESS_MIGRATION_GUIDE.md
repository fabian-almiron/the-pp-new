# WordPress to Clerk Migration Guide
## Complete Strategy for Password Reset & User Communication

    { email: 'user1@example.com', firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' },
    // ... more users

  for (const userData of users) {
    try {
      await clerk.users.createUser({
        emailAddress: [userData.email],
        firstName: userData.firstName,
        lastName: userData.lastName,
        // Don't set password - forces password reset
      });
      console.log(`‚úÖ Imported: ${userData.email}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`‚ùå Failed: ${userData.email}`, error);
